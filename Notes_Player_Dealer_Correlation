In our findings I have found 13 accounts of losses as shown below:

Losses on 3-10 occurred at 5AM , 8AM , 2PM , 8PM , 11 PM
Losses on 3-12 occurred at 5AM , 8AM , 2PM , 8PM , 11 PM
Losses on 3-15 occurred at 5AM , 8AM , 2PM

During the above times when losses occurred Mylie Scmidt was an active player in every case

When inspecting the logs of the Dealers Schedules I found the following:

Times and Dealers when Losses Occurred
05:00:00 AM Billy Jones 03-10
08:00:00 AM Billy Jones 03-10
02:00:00 PM Billy Jones 03-10
08:00:00 PM Billy Jones 03-10
11:00:00 PM Billy Jones 03-10
05:00:00 AM Billy Jones 03-12
08:00:00 AM Billy Jones 03-12
02:00:00 PM Billy Jones 03-12
08:00:00 PM Billy Jones 03-12
11:00:00 PM Billy Jones 03-12
05:00:00 AM Billy Jones 03-15
08:00:00 AM Billy Jones 03-15
02:00:00 PM Billy Jones 03-15

During the times when losses occurred Billy Jones was the dealer and he worked a total of 13 times

As you can see Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones were obviously colluding as they were both present during every instance of losses
